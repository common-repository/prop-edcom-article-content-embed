Prop-ed allows you to embed pieces from prop-ed.com into your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Prop-ed allows you to embed pieces from prop-ed.com into your WordPress blog.

When you use the embed script in conjunction with this plugin, pieces from prop-ed.com will be piped into the body of your WordPress post.

The embed will include a small link for people to press if they want to suggest a change.  If a person viewing your WordPress post wants to suggest a change to your piece, they hit the "prop-ed" button, and they will have the ability to suggest a change on prop-ed.com.  As the piece changes on prop-ed.com, so will your post!

Here's a step by step guide on how to use this plugin.

1.  Make sure you have installed and activated the Prop-ed wordpress plugin.

2.  On the piece view page, you will see an "Embed Piece" button in the top right hand corner.

3.  A modal will pop-up with the plain HTML embed script.  This isn't the script that you want to use for Wordpress.

4.  Click on the "Wordpress" button in the bottom right hand corner of the modal, and the modal will produce the embed script for Wordpress.  Copy the script.  The script will look like this: [proped url='http://prop-ed.com/piece/5/embed']

5.  Hit the button for a new post on WordPress.  Type in the post title as you normally would.  You will need to type in the piece title, but in the body of the post, past the embed script that you got from prop-ed.com.

6.  Post the piece, and now people will be able to suggest changes to it!

== Installation ==

1.  Download the plugin and unzip it.

2.  Upload the folder admin-management-xtended/ to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

3.  Activate the plugin from your WordPress admin panel.
Installation finished.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Does this plugin also embed the title from prop-ed.com? =

No.  The plugin is for pieces only.  We figured that that would be easier for formatting purposes - people like to do the titles for their pieces in different ways.
